This repository contains the source code and preprocessed dataset for The Web Conference 2021 paper [Knowledge-Preserving Incremental Social Event Detection via Heterogeneous GNNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08747.pdf).

# Datasets

## Twitter dataset
The Twitter dataset [1] is collected to evaluate social event detection methods. 
After filtering out repeated and irretrievable tweets, the dataset contains 68,841 manually labeled tweets 
related to 503 event classes, spread over a period of four weeks. 
Please find the original dataset at http://mir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/

## MAVEN dataset
MAVEN [2] is a general domain event detection dataset constructed from Wikipedia documents. 
We remove sentences (i.e., messages) that are associated with multiple event types. 
The filtered dataset contains 10,242 messages related to 154 event classes.
